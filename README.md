# Cruise Ship Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes performance data from cruise ships to understand trends, efficiency, and power consumption. By examining various metrics, we aim to provide insights into the operation and optimization of cruise vessels.

## Description

The cruise ship analysis focuses on the following aspects:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Collected data on power consumption, fuel flow rates, wind conditions, and other relevant parameters.
   - The dataset covers multiple cruise ships during their voyages.

2. **Performance Metrics**:
   - Calculated efficiency ratios, such as fuel consumption per nautical mile and power consumption per hour.
   - Key performance indicators (KPIs) were derived to assess overall efficiency.

3. **Voyage Distance**:
   - Estimated voyage distances by considering non-zero segment distances.
   - Consecutive zero-distance segments (stationary periods) were excluded.

4. **Average Power Consumption**:
   - For each voyage, we calculated the average power consumption.
   - This helps identify patterns and optimize energy usage.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
- Plotly

## Learnings and Challenges

- Understanding the impact of different factors on cruise ship performance.
- Handling missing data and outliers.
- Interpreting results in the context of real-world operations.
